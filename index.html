          We all have them. Those erratic, egocentric, off-the-wall bosses. They constantly spew cliches, absurdities and profanities. You can't always change your boss, but you can channel your frustration into something therapeutic and de-stressing like coloring! Laugh out loud at ridiculous quotes like, "how do you intend to face your problem if your problem is your face," or "looks like your phone screen is brighter than your future" with appropriately matching images.
